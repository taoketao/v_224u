Docs x words matrix -> bag of words rep.
Focus on rows = word representation
essential tool: distributional tools.

Questions: how do rows relate? How do cols relate? Which words epitomize {documents}? Which documents epitomize words (the information retrieval task}?
Other matrix designs:
 - word-by-doc most commonly used by far
    - sparse
 - word-by-word with a specified co-occurence relation.
    - invariant size wrt data
 - word-by-discourse context ...?! poorly explained
 - phonological segment (like letters) x feature values (nasal or not)
    - obviously useful for specific linguistic task

 - basically, lots of matrix design type options. Preprocessing, data cleaning/manipulation impt; numerical representation; dimensionality reduction, possibly adding supervised information for task leaning; vector comparison options.
   -> most options among these categories can be combined with each other as independent hyperparameters: matrix type, reweighting, dim red, vector comp.
