dimensionality reduction

goals: eliminate correlations and improve similarity results

LSA:
  2nd order cooccurrence:
    a dim reduction strategy projects down high dimensions.
    LSA based on SVD: for all A, exists: Am.n = Tm.m Sm.m Dn.m^T.
        S is diagonal; diag values are ordered.
        T and D are orthonormal: cols length normalized and
            orthogonal ie have cos dist of one
        LSA called 'truncated svd' sometimes

        two alternative terms can appear far since low cooccurrence
        but the svd and LSA trucation helps with this.

        (SVD more reliable on normal data...?)
        
        empirical: lsa helps distribute results more normally/evenly

Others:
    PCA (similar to LSA)
    Probabilistic LSA (PLSA) related to...
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding @ vix
