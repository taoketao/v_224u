Distributed word representations: matrix REWEIGHTING
goal of reweighting: amp important, salient; squash mundane & exceptions

freq is a poor metric for target semantic objects
for reweighting schemes:
    - cmp raw counts
    - cmp word freq
    - overall distribution
    - can it automatically filter out stopwords, etc

normalizations
    by L2, by L1 ((log?)-probabilistic)
    - Normalizing wrt col or wrt row can obscure amount of evidence.
      However, such schemes can help shift data to more normal.
      Empiricially this has a strong correlation to frequency, 
      mooting our point of normalization.
    - tf-idf breaks this: 
        tf is columnwise normalization of a word against the documents
        idf accounts for prevalence of the word amonst documents, ie
            a rough measure of how unique a word is to a document.
            idf with log can zero-out uninformative words.

            tf over doc, idf concerns all docs, linked over words.
        does indeed help balance reliability of too few data with
        uselessness of ubiquitous words.
        breaks correlation well.
        * cares precisely about how documents compare to each other wrt.
            their word contents.
    - pmi pointwise mutual information:
        * accounts for import of a word in one document to change the
            word's import in another, in true bayesian fashion of 
            explaining away.
        known to overemphasize low values.
        still breaks correlation with raw frequency.

      - variant: Laplacian smoothing is unpredictable 
      - variant: contextual discounting. attempts to bias pmi away
            from low-count items.
      - variant: positive pmi: floor at 0; because zero evidence events
            get higher preference than evidence with unexpected low
            probability.
    - chi-squared-influenced text called expected (?!)
    - t-test also works
    - tf-idf variants conscious of word distributions
    - pairwise distances across anonymous documents - for word cooccurrence?
