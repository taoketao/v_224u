C   14  10

Care only about row comparisons;
    freq(C,B) similar, but distribution(A,B) similar.

distances and similarities:
 - euclidean distance, sqrt sum across sqr-documents
    - not useful for above task.
 - cosine similarity: 
    1. normalize wrt L2 length of vector.
        graphically, projects all vectors onto hypersphere
    2. dot vectors and normalize by product of their L2 
        makes distance instead of similarity

 - manhattan L1 distance
 - Probabilistic distances based mostly on KL divergence
 - matching/set metrics
